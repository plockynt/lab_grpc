# Simple go & grpc lab

To test :

`cd cmd/apirest && go build && ./apirest`

Or :

In two terminals  
`cd cmd/grpcserver && go build && ./grpcserver`

`cd cmd/grpcclient && go build && ./grpcclient`

The gRPC client is a simple script that saves 2 projects then gets all projects.

You can use both REST api and gRPC server simultaneously.
